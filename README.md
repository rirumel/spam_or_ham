Spam or Ham?
In this project, I used a text dataset that has two features: Message, and Label (spam, ham). I trained a random forest classifier using the train set and validate the model using the test set. The model accuracy is almost 98%. Then with the help of Flask, I made a web application where I am using my trained random forest classifier in the back end and created an HTML form where users can type some text and after submitting the text, they will get to see whether their submitted text is Spam or Ham.
